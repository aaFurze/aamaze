### Pre-requisites/Requirements to use the Package

- Python version 3.7+ (Program originally written using Python 3.9 interpreter)

### Setting up the Virtual Environment
It is good practice to create a virtual environment for this project (and for any other project with non-standard-library dependencies).
See this guide for how to setup and activate a virtual environment: [Python docs](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment "Python docs")

NOTE: Ensure that you activate the environment once you have created it (See Python docs)


### Installing Dependencies (User Build)
Note: This guide assumes you are in the root project directory.

#### Poetry
If you have poetry installed on your machine, simply run poetry install.
<br/>
<br/>

#### setup.py

To install the relevant packages, select the directory that requirements.txt is in and run the following command:
```
pip install .
```
<br/>
<br/>

To check that all the packages have been installed, run the following command:
```
pip list
```
This should produce an output that looks contains these items
```
